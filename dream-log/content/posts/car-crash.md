# Car Crash

Went for a drive through a residential neighborhood. Was with some other people, dont know who though. The car was silent while we turned and saw the aftermath of a quite violent collision of another car. We saw chunks of what was once a truck as well as debris of loose tree limbs and various trash and refuse across the streets. We turned on to a boulevard, so the car was on the otherside of a shaded skinny median. I hopped out of the car without speaking. The car i was driving in must have been stopped.

I ran across the street and saw the man who was driving the crumbled mush of a truck sitting on the curb, not looking deathly but not in the best of spirits which didnt surprise me. I didnt interact with him at all, just waltzed past after scanning the scene and took out my phone. It was getting dark so I began flashing my phone flashlight at other cars coming down the road. Some of them registered the blinking flash light of at least something that should be paid attention to; less cars heeded the warning that I guess I was trying to convey.

I went for a walk, and eventually met a chain link fenced which blocked in a playing field that some kids were using for soccer. I walked through the fence gate diagonally through the field trying not to seem suspicious but also not advertising that I wanted to play. I likely did want to play but was never going to approach these tweens about coming on for a quick match. I was in some business casual outfit, with seamless shoes not ergonomic for kicking. Nevertheless the players shanked the ball over to my direction as I passed by. Trying to be cheeky I attempted to flick the ball up with the toe portion of my business shoes, severely miscalculating the attempted angle of ascent, sending the ball above my shoulders at an awkward obtuse angle. Never saw the ball actually come back down.
