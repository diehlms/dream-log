# Art School

The class and I sat in arrays of rectangular black-top rolling tables. About thirty people in total. We all went up, one by one, to demo our paintings to the class. We would bring up our canvases up to the easel in the front, and reveal the same painting subject to the audience. The subject was some kind of queen, in royal regalia. Most of us used the same techniques, and similar color palatte. Red velvety robe type garmint, pointy crown, big thone.

I went up and displayed my work. I dont remember talking about my piece. I thought it was okay. Nothing groundbreaking, but not bad. The painting was definitely a queen, or at least could easily be mistaken for one; if you told a stranger the person in the painting was a queen, the stranger would probably accept that. Some sloppy handiwork, some odd bright spots here and there. My classmates seemed to like it, but maybe that's an egoist hindsight.

The next artist went up. Her piece was amazing. It was inspiring and took the queen subject in a completely novel direction. I couldnt believe what I was seeing, nor believe how moved I was by it. The colors were alive and warm. The queen wasnt wearing clothes like in all the other paintings. There were scars, I definitely remember; big fleshy streaks across the back that looked raw and painful. The person was looking over their shoulder, seemingly through the viewer. No one in the audience seemed to have much of a reaction. Maybe I didn't either, since I dont remember talking or making any kind of noise or fidget.

I was in a car with two others, driving fast down a highway displaying the symptoms of a road beginning to clog. Lots of jerking brakes and lurching forward from the heavy foot of the driver. I wasnt driving, and I think i was in the back seat. The other passenger began convulsing shortly after coming out from under an overpass, sputtering saliva over the plexiglass. It took a minute for the driver to pay attention although neither one of us seemed to behave with what was probably the required urgency. We pulled over on the road and parked as if we simply making a quick pit stop at the grocery. The driver grabbed the woman having the heart attack and layed her on the road. Beginning CPR, he heaved and thrashed against her chest no doubt breaking ribs. We took turns but I doubt I was giving her the needed effort to revive her failing heart. I don't remember if she made it.

I was walking into the university student center and administration building. There was the odd mix of faculty and administration in suits walking between foosball and ping pong tables. The hallway I was in was bright with a sharp light blue hue coming through tiled glass bricks. A vendor was standing right inside the entrance. I offered her an egg from my satchel but she politely declined. She pointed up the hallway and said he might like one.

She was pointing to a friend from college that I think was walking his girlfriend on a leash. I offered him an egg and he graciously accepted. Sorry to say i dont think i offered his girlfriend an egg, though I had plenty to share.

At the same university, at the same student center I continued to walk through the hall until it opened up into the main foyer. The room expanded conically into a wide ampitheature with tall stadium seating. I had entered at the tip of the cone into the top row of seating. Everyone was glued to the tv monitors scattered along the walls and dangling from the roof. Nearly everyone had baseball jerseys, though we were in Germany. As dreams go it didnt make much sense.
