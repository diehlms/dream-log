# Austin

Whatever was of Austin is no longer. The streets inexplicably are void of asphalt, reverted back to their gravel origins or overgrown with brush. No houses had AC, though all the buildings were still there. The air was tinged with a brown orange usually seen around late summer when all the grass has burned away reflecting the brown of the soil back to the sky; a normal early September.

There was a person that mentioned everyone went down to San Antonio. Didn't sound like anything catastrophic happened, apparently it happened naturally and not so fast that San Antonio burst at the seams with all the new residents. I guess there were still a few stragglers in Austin, this man included. I don't remember seeing anyone though, it was really quiet.

I woke up and saw there was a shooting on 6th street. I guess someone brought a gun into a bar and the cops killed him, with a few shots in the chaos finding other patrons. I googled the story and accidentally clicked on the article about the other shooting.
