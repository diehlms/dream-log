I guess this one has a build up that I don't remember. As far as I can recall, I was on a quest to find out where my sisters were and if confronted with their captor, enact my vengance. Hard to imagine myself enacting vengance in real life, but oh well.

I pulled my car into a grove, passing a lot of beat up cars parked alongside a brook, maybe 20 in total. Oak trees were outstretched over the road, shading most of the property. It was quite beautiful, aside from the junk cars, if you could gaze at the main house which resided along a river. The day was muggy and slightly cloudy.

The property owner came out to see who pulled in. He asked quite suspiciously who I was. If I told him, I quickly asked him if he knew where my sisters were. Unclear to me how or why I thought he knew where they would be, I probed and accused more forcefully until he relented. He pointed me to a shack behind the main house and asked me to follow him. Wordlessly he led me to a small footbridge wide enough for only one person at a time. I went first, reaching the other side and sensing his raised fist behind me.

I turned around and caught him migrating his stance from one of threat to a wide outstretched yawn. Clever tactic I suppose. He unlocked the shed. Nothing. I became berzerk, I started throwing fists and we started going at it, dragging each other to the floor. Blow after blow for minutes, until we drain our energies. No upper hand.

"What did you hit me for", he asked pantingly. "You know where they are" I answereed with all the courage and accusatory force I could find in my psyche between gasps for air.

"I dont even know who you are"

"..."

"Everyone's a liar"

Hard to know what to make of this one.
